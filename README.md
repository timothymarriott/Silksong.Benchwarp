# Silksong.BenchwarpMod
Mod which creates a clickable menu on the pause screen to alter your current bench respawn point. Use warp button (or save and quit) after selection to travel to new bench. By default, only benches visited after installing the mod can be destinations.

This is a fork of the hollow knight benchwarp mod, found here https://github.com/homothetyhk/HollowKnight.BenchwarpMod/
